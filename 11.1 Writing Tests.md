## How to write test

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:

1.  Set up any needed data or state.
2.  Run the code you want to test.
3.  Assert the results are what you expect.
---
- a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the `test` attribute.
	- Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; 
	- one example is the `derive` attribute we used with structs in [ Chapter 5 ]
- To change a function into a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`.
- Run these annotated functions with `cargo run`. Will result in Pass or Fail.
```rust
// src/lib.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn another() {
        panic!("Make this test fail");
    }
}
```
- `assert!()` macro serves as an example, it takes `bool` in parameters, 
	- here `(2+2, 4)` returns true hence test case is `ok`.
- While the `another()` will return `FAILED` because we explicitly ran `panic!`
- Another example of `assert!`:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        let larger = Rectangle {
            width: 8,
            height: 7,
        };
        let smaller = Rectangle {
            width: 5,
            height: 1,
        };
		// can_hold returns a bool
        assert!(larger.can_hold(&smaller));
    }
}
```
```console
running 1 test
test tests::larger_can_hold_smaller ... ok
```
---
Testing Equality with the `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` Macros
---
`assert!` macro only indicates that it got a `true/false` value for the `==` expression, without printing the values that led to the `true/false` value.
- `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` macros compare two arguments for equality or inequality, respectively. 
- the parameters to equality assertion functions are called `left` and `right`  (in other languages: `expected` and `actual` )
- They’ll also print these two equality parameters if the assertion fails, which makes it easier to see _why_ the test failed:
```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 3 // test case Fail, return 5 instead of 4
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_adds_two() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo test

running 1 test
test tests::it_adds_two ... FAILED

failures:

---- tests::it_adds_two stdout ----
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `4`,
 right: `5`', src/lib.rs:11:9
```
- When the assertions fail, these macros print their arguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must implement the `PartialEq` and `Debug` traits.
- For structs and enums you’ll need to implement `PartialEq` to assert equality of those types and `Debug` to print the values when the assertion fails.
	- `#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)`

---
- Under the surface, the `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` macros use the operators `==` and `!=`, respectively.
---
Custom Failure Messages
---
custom messages are in `format!` macro format.
```rust
pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello {}!", name)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(
            result.contains("Carol"),
            "Greeting did not contain name, value was `{}`",
            result
        );
    }
}
```
```console
running 1 test
test tests::greeting_contains_name ... FAILED

failures:

---- tests::greeting_contains_name stdout ----
thread 'main' panicked at 'Greeting did not contain name, value was `Hello!`', src/lib.rs:12:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
---
Checking for panics with `should_panic`
---
```rust
// --snip--

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got {}.",
                value
            );
        } else if value > 100 {
            panic!(
                "Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got {}.",
                value
            );
        }

        Guess { value }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "less than or equal to 100")]
    fn greater_than_100() {
        Guess::new(200);
    }
}
```
---
Using `Result<T, E>` in Tests
---
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
        if 2 + 2 == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
        }
    }
}
```
- You can’t use the `#[should_panic]` annotation on tests that use `Result<T, E>`. 
- To assert that an operation returns an `Err` variant, _don’t_ use the question mark operator on the `Result<T, E>` value. Instead, use `assert!(value.is_err())`
