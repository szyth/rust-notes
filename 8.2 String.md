2 Types of String in Rust
- At Core language:
	- `str` string slice, aka  `string literal`
		- usually seen in its borrowed form `&str`
		- unaffected by ownerships.
		- stored in the program’s binary and are therefore string slices.
		- UTF-8 encoded
		- `let byte_escape = "I'm writing \x52\x75\x73\x74!";`
- At Standard Rust library:
	- `String`
		- A `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>` vector of Bytes.
		- stored in HEAP.
		- a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type

_This doc focuses only on Standard `String`._

Creating a new String
---
- `let mut s = String::new();`
- `String::from` and `to_string` do the same thing
```rust
// string slice/literal
let data = "initial contents";

// convert to String
let s = data.to_string();
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
let s = String::from(data)
let s = String::from("initial contents")

```
- Since strings are UTF-8 encoded, following values are valid:
```rust
    let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
    let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
    let hello = String::from("Hello");
    let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
    let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
    let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
    let hello = String::from("你好");
    let hello = String::from("Olá");
    let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
    let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

Update a String
---

##### Append with:
- `push_str(<str literal>)` method
- this method takes string literal as argument, as they dont lose ownership.
```rust
 let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
    let s2 = "bar";
    s1.push_str(s2);
    println!("s2 is {}", s2); // still works, no ownership problems.
```
- Single Character push using `push()`
```rust
  let mut s = String::from("lo");
    s.push('l');
```
---
##### Concatenate with:
- `+`
	- takes ownership.
	- one Heap allocation for every time `+` is called.
- `format!` macro
	- much easier to read
	- `format!` macro uses references so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");
// + operator
let myString = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;

// format! macro, works similar to print!
let myString = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);

////////////////////////

let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```
- it looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement instead does the following:
	1.  `add` takes ownership of `s1`,
	2.  it appends a copy of the contents of `s2` to `s1`,
	3.  and then it returns back ownership of `s1`.
- The `+` operator uses the `add` method, whose signature looks like this:
	- `fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {`
	- the type of `&s2` is `&String`, not `&str`, so why does it compile? because: 
- the compiler can _coerce_ the `&String` argument into a `&str`.
- When we call the `add` method, Rust uses a _deref coercion_, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]` [ chapter 15 ]
- since `add` does not take ownership of the `s` parameter, `s2` will still be a valid `String` after this operation.
---
##### Indexing into String:
- Rust strings don’t support indexing. (workaround below)
```rust
// Compile Error
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```
- But why? 
	- To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.
- As its a `utf 8` (8bits) not `ascii` (7bits), sometimes there may be characters that cant be indexed properly:
- `let hello = String::from("Hola");` takes 4 Bytes
-  similarly, `let hello = String::from("Здра");` should also take 4 Bytes? Nope it takes 8 BYTES as each Scalar Value is taking 2bytes. See the difference bw `utf` and `ascii`.
- so if we will do `&hello[0];` indexing, we expect to get `З` char, but we wont as it is taking 2 bytes rather than 1 byte, and indexes can only access 1 byte at a time.
- Another Example using a `grapheme cluster`:
	- If we look at the Hindi word "नमस्ते", it is stored as a vector of `u8` values that looks like this:

```text
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164, 224, 165, 135]
```

- That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s `char` type is, those bytes look like this
- There are six `char` values here:
```text
['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
```

**THIS IS HOW TO USE INDEX**
```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..4]; // s = Зд
```
- If we were to give `[1..5]` then the code will Panic at runtime as each Scalar value is taking 2bytes.
	- indexes represents 1 byte.
---
##### Methods for iterating over String
- For individual Unicode scalar values, use the `chars()` method
```rust
for ch in "Зд".char() {
	println!("{}",ch)
}
// output
З
д
```
- For raw bytes, use `bytes()` method:
```rust
for b in "Зд".bytes() {
    println!("{}", b);
}
// output
208
151
208
180

```

##### Strings are not so simple
- strings are complicated
- Programmers have to put more thought into handling UTF-8 data upfront
- but it prevents you from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters

_The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built off the `String` and `&str` types to help handle these complex situations correctly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like `contains` for searching in a string and `replace` for substituting parts of a string with another string._
