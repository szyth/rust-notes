Is an Important Topic: 
- Covered in BOTH BOOKS ( 2nd link is easier ): 
	- https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html
	- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html
- All theory to show why rust is secure as a low level language.
- Read SUMMARY for quick reference.

From other Book:
- string literal (&str):
	- let s = "Hello";
	- Memory allocated at compile time, since size is known
	- metadata has
		- ptr
		- len
	- stored in Stack or heap etc
- String:
	- is a vector Struct
	- let s = String::from("Hello"); // or "Hello".to_string()
	- Memory allocated at run time, since size is unknown
	- stored in Heap, because variable size
	- metadata made up of 3 parts ( since a Vector ), all saved in Stack
		- ptr -> points to Data in Heap
		- len
		- capacity
	- Hence, if we do,
	- let s1 = String::from("Hello");
	- let s2 = s1;
	- It will move the s1 metadata and Heap Data into s2, and s1 will no longer be functional
	- To keep s1 alive (deep copy) use clone(),
	- let s2 = s1.clone();
		- clone() only works on datatypes storing data in Heap as scalar datatypes like Integer has fixed size and thus can be saved in Stack thereby not needing to copy data to/from Heap
