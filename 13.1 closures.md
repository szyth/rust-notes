- closures are anonymous functions 
- can be saved in a variable or passed as arguments to other functions

---

The [`unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_else) is defined by the standard library. It takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value `T` (the same type stored in the `Some` variant of the `Option<T>`). 
- second argument `f` is the closure
	- Using `FnOnce` in the trait bound expresses the constraint that `unwrap_or_else` is only going to call `f` at most one time.
	- if the `Option` is `Some`, `f` won’t be called. If the `Option` is `None`, `f` will be called once.
```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else<F>(self, f: F) -> T
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) => x,
            None => f(),
        }
    }
}
```

```rust
// example
let user_preference = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
.
.
.
 fn giveaway(&self, user_preference: Option<ShirtColor>) -> ShirtColor {
	user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
	// this will return ShirtColor::Red
}
```

- For `Some(T)` variant, `unwrap_or_else` returns the value from within the `Some`. 
- For `None` variant, `unwrap_or_else` calls the closure and returns the value returned by the closure.

#### Closure Type Inference and Annotation
- Closures don’t usually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value like `fn` functions do.
- They are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context hence the compiler can infer the types of the parameters and the return type.
- An example of optional type annotations of the parameter and return value types in the closure:
```rust
 let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
	println!("calculating slowly...");
	thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
	num
};
```
- Function vs Closure:
	1. Function
	2. Fully annotated Closure
	3. Closure without type annotations
	4. Closure without brackets (since its only 1 expression)
```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }  
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 }; 
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 }; 
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ; 
```
- If type annotation is not present for closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of their parameters and for their return value.
```rust
    let example_closure = |x| x;

    let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
    let n = example_closure(5); // Compile Error
    // inferred type is String, found Integer
```
---
- Rust permits pattern matching within closure arguments, including the use of the underscore. For example, you could write the following:
```rust
let f = |_| (); // sometimes called the "toilet closure"
let s = String::from("Hello")`
f(s);
```
- `f` causes `s` to be immediately dropped
- **Context**: The toilet closure is similar to [`std::mem::drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.drop.html), i.e. a function that moves an argument and causes it to be dropped.

Values moving into `closure`
---
do revisit once:  [Capturing References or Moving Ownership](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch13-01-closures.html#capturing-references-or-moving-ownership)
```rust
let list = vec![1, 2, 3];

let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {:?}", list);

println!("Before calling closure: {:?}", list);
```
- we can have multiple immutable references to `list` at the same time
- the above `only_borrows` can be used as a `fn` like so:
	- `only_borrows()` and will print the closure.
```rust
// similar to this
fn only_borrows() {
	println!("From closure: {:?}", list);
}
```
- To move a value inside the `closure` use `move` keyword:
```rust
fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

	// list moved inside this closure
    thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {:?}", list))
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}
```
- If the main thread maintained ownership of `list` but ended before the new thread did and dropped `list`, the immutable reference in the thread would be invalid. 
- Therefore, the compiler requires that `list` be moved into the closure given to the new thread so the reference will be valid.
- Another example, `add_suffix` mutably borrows `s` between its definition and use, so the `println` (a read of `s`) is invalid.
```rust
// Move with String
fn main() {
	let mut s = String::from("Hello");
	let mut add_suffix = || s.push_str(" world"); // s moved into closure
	println!("{s}"); // hence compile error here
	add_suffix();  
```

Moving Captured Values Out of Closures and the Fn Traits
---
Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value, a closure body can do any of the following: 
1. move a captured value out of the closure, 
2. mutate the captured value, 
3. neither move nor mutate the value or capture nothing from the environment to begin with.

The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects which traits the closure implements:
1.  `FnOnce` : All closures implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement `FnOnce` and none of the other `Fn` traits, because it can only be called once.
	1. See example: scroll up to `unwrap_or_else()`
2.  `FnMut` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.
3.  `Fn` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body and that don’t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.

#### `sort_by_key` uses `FnMut`
```rust
// print the list sorted (asc) by their width
 let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 10, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 5 },
        Rectangle { width: 7, height: 12 },
    ];

    list.sort_by_key(|r| r.width);
    println!("{:#?}", list);
```
- The reason `sort_by_key` is defined to take an `FnMut` closure is that it calls the closure multiple times: once for each item in the slice. The closure `|r| r.width` doesn’t capture, mutate, or move out anything from its environment, so it meets the trait bound requirements.
- In contrast the compiler won’t let us use a closure that implements just the `FnOnce` trait with `sort_by_key`. Because it moves a value out of the environment.
```rust
// program to count the number of times `sort_by_key` is called
let mut list = .....
let mut sort_operations = vec![];
let value = String::from("by key called");

list.sort_by_key(|r| {
	sort_operations.push(value); // compile error
	r.width
});
println!("{:#?}", list);
```
- `value` variable ownership moved out of closure into `sort_operations`, hence compile error.
	- To fix this, we need to change the closure body so that it doesn’t move values out of the environment.
```rust
let mut list = .....
let mut num_sort_operations = 0;
list.sort_by_key(|r| {
	num_sort_operations += 1;
	r.width
});
println!("{:#?}, sorted in {num_sort_operations} operations", list);
```
