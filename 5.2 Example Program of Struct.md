```rust
// area of rectangle will need width and height
// passing it in args(width, height) is confusing so we'll pass only one arg
// can be achieved by tuples but tuples lack proper naming to access its childs tuple.0, etc
// hence we use structs 
{
	width: 2,
	heigth: 4
}
```
- borrows of structs is common.
	- ownership is maintained with `main()` (or in whichever fn the struct instance is created) most of the time.
- using struct with `width` and `height` fields conveys that the width and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to the values rather than using the tuple index values of `0` and `1`. This is a win for clarity.
- use `#[derive(Debug)]` trait at start of file, to print debug information.
- `println!` prints in `stdout` 
- `dbg!` macro prints in `stderr`
- Program:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
	width: u32,
	height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
	// methods always defined under struct, enum or trait scope
	// any operations on struct instance to be done under this block.
	// here we have single impl block for Rectangle struct, but we can have multiple too each with 1 method
	// first parameter is always self in methods only
	// &self is short for self: &Self
	// borrowing self, not ownership, coz we wanna only read data in struct ( only for READ case, for WRITE case use &mut self)
	fn area(&self) -> u32 {
		self.width * self.height
	}

	// method to check if value is empty
	fn width(&self) -> bool {
		self.width > 0
	}

	// set width, getter-setter, WRITE case here:
	fn set_width(&mut self, width: u32) {
		self.width = width
	}

	// method to check if rect2 can fit in rect1
	fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
		self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
	}

	// associated fn, not a method
	fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
		Self {
			width: size,
			height: size,
		}
	}
}

fn main() {
	// giving it mut to perform WRITE operation in setter.
	let mut rect1 = Rectangle {
		width: 30,
		height: 50,
	};
	// No mut, no WRITE, only READ allowed
	let rect2 = Rectangle {
		width: 50,
		height: 20,
	};
	
	// setter, set width to 50
	rect1.set_width(50);
	
	// print only when width is > 0
	if rect1.width() {
		println!("Area of rectangle {}", rect1.area())
	} else {
		println!("null width")
	}
	
	// check if rect2 can fit in rect1
	println!("can rect1 hold rect2?: {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
	
	// get square of width and height
	let square = Rectangle::square(3);
	println!("{:#?}", square)
}
