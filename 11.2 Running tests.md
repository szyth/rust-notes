By default the tests are run in parallel.
- Meaning if multiple tests depends on one-another the test will result in wrong values.
- Hence we have to run tests serially:
```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```
---
Showing functions output
---
- By default, the `print!` does not gets printed in console with `cargo test`.
- To enable this;
```bash
cargo test -- --show-output
```
---
Running a Subset of Tests by Name
---
- In large codebases, while youre working on some module, you can test that particular function using its name instead of running all tests:
```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

	// function 1
    #[test]
    fn add_two_and_two() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
    
	// function 2
    #[test]
    fn add_three_and_two() {
        assert_eq!(5, add_two(3));
    }

	// function 3
    #[test]
    fn one_hundred() {
        assert_eq!(102, add_two(100));
    }
}
```
```bash
cargo test one_hundred

# will run function 3

##########################
## Filtering
##########################
cargo test add

# will run function 1 and 2. Pattern match.

```
----
Ignoring a Test
---
_Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute, so you might want to exclude them_
```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
}

#[test]
#[ignore]
fn expensive_test() {
    // code that takes an hour to run
}
```
- If we want to run only the ignored tests, we can use 
```bash
cargo test -- --ignored
```
- If you want to run all tests whether theyâ€™re ignored or not, you can run:
```bash
cargo test -- --include-ignored
```
