- Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

---
### Scalar Datatypes
_stored in stack, because fixed size_

#### Integer
- integer types default to `i32` 
- Signed numbers are stored using [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.
- the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”.

>A variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and 255. If we set value to 256, _integer overflow_ will occur, which can result in “wrap around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. 
>This scenario is for `release` compile mode, for `debug` mode the program will Panic and exit.
- Mitigate Integer Overflow:
	-   Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`
	-   Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods
	-   Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods
	-   Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with `saturating_*` methods

#### Floating Point 
- `f32`, `f64`
```rust
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```
---
#### Boolean
- true, false
```rust
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```
---
#### Char
- 4 bytes (32bits, ASCII is 7 bits lol)
- Single quotes, unlike String.
- represents a Unicode Scalar Value. (range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive)
```rust
 let c = 'z';
```
---
### Compoud Datatypes
two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### Tuple
- Fixed length.
- multi type data allowed.
- access a tuple element 
	- by destructuring
	- by using a period (`.`)
- The tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_.
	- Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.
- structs are more flexible than tuples
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1.1);

	// destructuring
    let (_, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {y}");

	// Period
    let one = tup.2; // value 1.1
}
```


#### Array
- Single chunk of memory allocated on the stack.
- Fixed length.
- only same type data allowed.
- access element by using square brackets([])
- isn’t as flexible as the vector type which _is_ allowed to grow or shrink in size.
- Better to use Vectors ( to be covered in chapter 8 )
```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let a = [3; 5]; // [3,3,3,3,3]
```
