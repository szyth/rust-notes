#### If
- is an expression
- sometimes called _arms_, just like the arms in `match`
- condition in this code _must_ be a `bool`
	- `if number {}` doesnt work,  as `int` is not translated into `bool`, unlike other Languages.
	- Rust does not have a concept of "truthy" or "falsy" values.
- can be used in a `let` statement since it is an expression:
	- `let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };`
```rust
let number = 3;
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } 
	 else if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
	else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }

// this will throw error, same type only allowed
let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
```

---
#### Loops
- `loop`, `while`, and `for`
	- supports `break` and `continue`

```rust

loop {
	println!("again!");
}

while number != 0  {
	println!("{number}!");
	number -= 1;
}

// precise way to iterate over array
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
for element in a {
	println!("the value is: {element}");
}

// in a range, 1 to 3 ( 4 excluded )
for number in (1..4).rev() {
	println!("{number}!");
}
```
- `break` can return data, also Loops can have names:
```rust
let mut count = 0;
	// naming convention 
    'loop1: loop {
        'loop2: loop {
            if count == 2 {
                break 'loop1;
                // or break with return data
                break count * 2;
            }
        }
        count += 1;
}
```
