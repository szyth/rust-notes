The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent _dangling references_, which cause a program to reference data other than the data itâ€™s intended to reference. Consider the unsafe program in Listing 10-16, which has an outer scope and an inner scope.
```rust
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```
An attempt to use a reference whose value has gone out of scope.
