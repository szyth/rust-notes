- when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values we use `if let` rather than `match`
- `if let` is syntax sugar for a `match`
- If we have a situation in which our program has logic that is too verbose to express using a `match`, remember that `if let` is in our Rust toolbox as well.
```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);

// match case
match config_max {
	Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
	_ => (),
}

// similar if-let, since only one pattern matching needs to be done
if let Some(max) = config_max {
	println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
}

// can also have else, if needed
if let Some(max) = config_max {
	println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
}
else {
	println!("Not a max number")
}
```
