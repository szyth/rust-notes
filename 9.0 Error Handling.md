- Rust groups errors into two major categories: 
	- _recoverable_ 
		- such as a _file not found_ error, we most likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. 
		- `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors
	- _unrecoverable_ errors. 
		- Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the program.
		- `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error.


_Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as `exceptions`_.

we’ll explore considerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop execution.
