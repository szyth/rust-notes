**Revisit once **

_Traits are similar to a feature often called `interfaces` in other languages, although with some differences._
- We use _trait bounds_ to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.
---
Defining a Trait
---
Scenario based example
- Lets suppose we have 2 structs :
```rust
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}
```
- we are tasked to create a Library Crate `aggregator` that can print Summary of data inside these 2 structs,
	- this can be achieved by defining a trait:
```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```
- After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly brackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce that any type that has the `Summary` trait will have the method `summarize` defined with this signature exactly.
---
Implementing the above trait
---
Now that we’ve defined the desired signatures of the `Summary` trait’s methods, we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator.
```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```
- `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` struct uses the headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of `summarize`. 
- For the `Tweet` struct, we define `summarize` as the username followed by the entire text of the tweet.
- Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods with only addition of `for` keyword and name of type.
---
Calling this crate in our Binary crate
---
- Now that the library has implemented the `Summary` trait on `NewsArticle` and `Tweet`, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` in the same way we call regular methods. The only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the types. Here’s an example of how a binary crate could use our `aggregator` library crate:
```rust
// src/main.rs

use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```
- This code prints `1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people`.

_One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the trait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard library traits like `Display` on a custom type like `Tweet` as part of our `aggregator` crate functionality, because the type `Tweet` is local to our `aggregator` crate._

_But we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate, because `Display` and `Vec<T>` are both defined in the standard library and aren’t local to our `aggregator` crate._


---
Default Implementations
---
useful to have a default behavior for some or all of the methods in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.
- Specify a default string for the `summarize` method of the `Summary` trait instead of only defining the method signature.
```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}
```
- To use a default implementation to summarize instances of `NewsArticle`, we specify an empty `impl` block with:
```rust
// src/lib.rs
impl Summary for NewsArticle {}
```

```rust
// src/main.rs
 let article = NewsArticle {
        headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
        location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
        author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
        content: String::from(
            "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
             hockey team in the NHL.",
        ),
    };

    println!("New article available! {}", article.summarize());
```
- This code prints `New article available! (Read more...)`.
---
- Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait.
- we could define the `Summary` trait to have a `summarize_author` method whose implementation is required, and then define a `summarize` method that has a default implementation that calls the `summarize_author` method:
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}

```
- To use this version of `Summary`, we only need to define `summarize_author` when we implement the trait on a type:

```rust
impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
```

```rust
// src/main.rs
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

- This code prints `1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)`.
---
Traits as Parameters 
---
```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```
- _TRAIT Bound_ syntax:
```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```
- The `impl Trait` syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other cases.
- Another example with 2 parameters:
```rust
pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {

pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
```
###### Multiple trait bounds
```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {

// Trait bound
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```


###### `where` clause
_functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list, making the function signature hard to read_
- So instead of writing this:

```rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```
- Do this, `where` clause: 
```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
```
---
Returning types that Implements traits
---
```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```
- The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is especially useful in the context of closures and iterators  [ Chapter 13 ]

_However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you’re returning a single type. Returning either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` isn’t allowed due to restrictions around how the `impl Trait` syntax is implemented in the compiler:_
```rust
// compile error
fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from(
                "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
            ),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),
        }
    } else {
        Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
        }
    }
}
```
