- Adding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem.
- `use` only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the `use` occurs.
```rust

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Compile Error, because mod {} is a different scope. Only same scope can use `use`
    }
}

// Fix this via:
pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
	hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // This will work fine. Same scope
}

// ORRRR
mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        super::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // use super to move one scope up.
    }
}
```
- you might have wondered why we specified `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` and then called `hosting::add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant` rather than specifying the `use` path all the way out to the `add_to_waitlist` function to achieve the same result like this?
```rust
use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist(); // not recommend, because: 
}
```
- Answer: Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path.
- On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, Hashmap, and other items with `use`, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path.
- There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.

as keyword; aka alias 
---
- Following `Result` conflicts from `fmt` and `io`, hence we use `as` to differentiate:
```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

`pub use` : Pending

External packages and `use`
---
- the standard `std` library is also a crate that’s external to our package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we don’t need to change _Cargo.toml_ to include `std`. But we do need to refer to it with `use` to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example, with `HashMap` we would use this line:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

---
Nested Paths in `use`
---

```rust
// NOPE
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

// YES
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
```

```rust
// NOPE
use std::io;
use std::io::Write;

// YES
use std::io::{self, Write};
```
---
Glob `*` operator
---
- bring _all_ public items defined in a path into scope.
```rust
use std::collections::*;
```
