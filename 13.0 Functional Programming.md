we’ll cover:

-   _Closures_, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
	- Anonymous Function
-   _Iterators_, a way of processing a series of elements
-   How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12
-   The performance of closures and iterators (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you might think!)

Rust features, such as pattern matching and enums, are also influenced by the functional style.


_Mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust code._
