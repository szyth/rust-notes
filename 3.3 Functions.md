- uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable names. 
	- `fn im_a_function()`
	- `let im_a_variable`
- Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions( before or after `main()` ), only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.
- In function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter.
```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}
// with argument
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
// function return type with ->
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

#### Statement vs Expressions
|Statement|Expression|
|---|---|
| instructions that perform some action and do not return a value|_Expressions_ evaluate to a resulting value|
|ends with ;|never ends with ;|
|No data returned| returns data|
|eg. `let x = 4;`|eg. `5+6`, function calls, macro calls, if, inner Scope {} are all Expressions|
- `let x = y = 6;` DOES NOT WORK IN RUST, because `y = 6;` is a statement which returns nothing hence nothing left to give `x = `
