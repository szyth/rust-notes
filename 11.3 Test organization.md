The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration tests. 
- _Unit tests_ are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces. 
- _Integration tests_ are entirely external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test.

_The three sections of test output include the unit tests, the integration test, and the doc tests._

---
Unit tests
---
The `#[cfg(test)]` annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run the test code only when you run `cargo test`, not when you run `cargo build`
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```
- The attribute `cfg` stands for _configuration_ and tells Rust that the following item should only be included given a certain configuration option. 
- In this case, the configuration option is `test`, which is provided by Rust for compiling and running tests. 
- By using the `cfg` attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only if we actively run the tests with `cargo test`.

##### Testing Private functions
Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.
- All unit tests in a given file have access to that file's private functions, regardless of being in a `mod tests` or not.
- Here the `internal_adder` is private fn ( no `pub` ) and can still be tested.
```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
```
---
Integration Tests
---
_Integration tests check that many parts of the library work together correctly_

In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use the library’s public API to test the code in the same way external code will use it, which means they can only call functions that are part of your library’s public API. 
- To create integration tests, you first need a _tests_ directory.
```text
adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs
```

```rust
// tests/integration_test.rs
use adder;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
```
- Each file in the `tests` directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our library into each test crate’s scope.
- For that reason we add `use adder` at the top of the code, which we didn’t need in the unit tests.
- We don’t need to annotate any code in _tests/integration_test.rs_ with `#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo treats the `tests` directory specially and compiles files in this directory only when we run `cargo test`

Integration Tests for Binary Crates
---
If our project is a binary crate that only contains a **src/main.rs** file and doesn’t have a src/lib.rs file, we can’t create _integration tests_ in the tests directory and bring functions defined in the **src/main.rs** file into scope with a `use` statement.

This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a straightforward _src/main.rs_ file that calls logic that lives in the _src/lib.rs_ file. Using that structure, integration tests _can_ test the library crate with `use` to make the important functionality available. If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the _src/main.rs_ file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t need to be tested.
