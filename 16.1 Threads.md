- Threads: a feature that makes the independent parts of a program to run simultaneously.
- eg. Web server with multiple threads to respond to more than one request at the same time.

Because threads can run simultaneously, there’s no inherent guarantee about the order in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead to problems, such as:

-   Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in an inconsistent order
-   Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both threads from continuing
-   Bugs that happen only in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix reliably

- Here, when the **main thread** of a Rust program completes, all spawned threads are shut down, whether or not they have finished running.
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
	// main thread {}

	// spawned thread
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}
```
- use `join` to let ALL the threads to complete, then only finish.
	- The return type of `thread::spawn` is `JoinHandle`
- FIXED now:
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 { // Line X
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```
- Program waits for threads to complete wherever `handle.join().unwrap();` is called.
	- Calling it before `Line x`  wont print the proceeding `for` until the Thread has Finished.

### Using `move` Closures with Threads
- To send value from `main` thread to `spawned` thread, we use `move` with a closure.
	- "transferring ownership of values from one thread to another"
- By adding the `move` keyword before the closure, we force the closure to take ownership of the values it’s using rather than allowing Rust to infer that it should borrow the values.
```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```
