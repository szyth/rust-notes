- Similar to functions
- unlike functions, methods are defined within context of struct, enum or trait.
- useful in Getter-Setters.
- Refer: [[5.2 Example Program of Struct]] for the program implementation.
- first argument is always `self` 
	- `&self` is short for `self: &Self`
	- For reading:  `&self`, aka borrowing not ownership, coz we wanna only read data in struct.
	- For writing: `&mut self` 
		- add `mut` in struct instance too:
```
let mut rect = Rectangle {
    width: 0,
    height: 0
};
```
- in example program we have single `impl` block for `Rectangle` struct, but we can have multiple `impl` blocks for each method as well.
- All functions defined within an `impl` block are called _associated functions_
	- Associated fns doesnt need to be methods always
		- ie they need not include `self` as a parameter
		- often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct.
- docs used * at end of page, check why?
	- pointers?
