- Parallel Programming

>we’ll refer **concurrent and/or parallel** as **concurrent**.

Here are the topics we’ll cover in this chapter:
-   How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time
-   _Message-passing_ concurrency, where channels send messages between threads
-   _Shared-state_ concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece of data
-   The `Sync` and `Send` traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library
