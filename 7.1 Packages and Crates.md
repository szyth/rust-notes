### Crates
- A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.
- Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate.
- Two Forms: 
	- Binary Crate:
		- programs we can compile to an executable that we can run.
		- must have `main` function.
	- Library Crate: 
		- they don’t compile to an executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects
		- dont have `main` function.
		- eg: `rand` crate that generates random numbers [[2. Guessing Game]]
- Though in rust community `crate` is interchageably used with the concept of `library`.
- The _crate root_ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate
	- `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs` are called crate roots of Binary Crate and Library Crate respectively (both crates will have the package name by default). 
- The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate’s module structure, known as the _module tree_.

### Packages
- `cargo new package_name`
- a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality.
- A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to build those crates.
- A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one library crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that’s a library or binary crate.
- A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the _src/bin_ directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.
`cargo run --bin new_file`
