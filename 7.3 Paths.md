- To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to know its path.
- A path can take two forms:
	- An _absolute path_ is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal `crate`.
	- A _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.
- Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (`::`).
- Our preference in general is to specify **absolute paths** because it’s more likely we’ll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.
- In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.
- Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules.
	- Rust does give you the option to expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.
	- making the module public doesn’t make its contents public. The `pub` keyword on a module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.

> To design a Good API, packages with the pattern of containing both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary crate to start an executable that calls code with the library crate. This lets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package provides, because the library crate’s code can be shared. Chapter 12


### Super for relative paths
- super is similar to `..` in linux filesystem
- this means select `../deliver_order` module ie `crate::deliver_order()`

### [Making Structs and Enums Public](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#making-structs-and-enums-public)

- If we use `pub` before a `struct` definition, we make the `struct` public, but the struct’s fields will still be private.
	- We can make each struct field public or not on a case-by-case basis.
- In contrast, if we make an `enum` public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the `pub` before the `enum` keyword
```rust
// struct
pub struct Breakfast {
	pub toast: String,
	seasonal_fruit: String,
}

struct Point(pub i32, pub i32)

// enum
pub enum Appetizer {
	Soup,
	Salad,
}
```
- Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with `pub` in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.
