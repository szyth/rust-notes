- `Box<T>` is a pointer
- Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack.
- Box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).
- Most often used:
	-   When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time.
	-   When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so.
	-   When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type [[chapter 17.2]]

### Using a `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap
- basic syntax to store `i32`, in heap
```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```
- when a box goes out of scope, as `b` does at the end of `main`, it will be deallocated. 
- The deallocation happens both for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).

-----
- `Deref` trait allows `Box<T>` values to be treated like references.
- `Drop` trait cleans up the heap data after `Box<T>` goes out of scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 1;
    let b = Box::new(&mut n);
    **b += 1;
    println!("{}", n);
}

/////////////////////// OUTPUT /////////////
2
```
- a `Box` variable can be updated with `**` as above ?
	- Yes: A box can hold a mutable reference, so dereferencing `b` twice gets back to `n`

```rust
// For a compile target with a 64-bit architecture, what is the minimum possible size in memory (in bytes) of `x` on the stack?
let x: [Box<(usize, usize)>; 4]

/// ANSWER
/// A box contains a pointer, which is 8 bytes on a 64-bit architecture. An array of 4 pointers is therefore at least 4 * 8 =
32 bytes
```
