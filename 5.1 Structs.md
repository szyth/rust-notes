- structs give us a way of grouping together related fields and data
- structs are more flexible than tuples: you donâ€™t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.
- can be declared inside or outside functions.
- any operation on struct data should be done using `impl` and `methods`. Refer [[5.3 Methods]]
- storing values may depend on its type, like below `String` is saved in Heap with pointer in Stack, while `int` and `bool` directly in Stack:

```rust
// also a valid struct syntax
struct Point(i32, i32);
fn some_function() {
	let p = Point(1, 2);
}
///////////////////////////////////////
struct User {
    active: bool, // name and type, called as fields
    username: String, // since this is String, value stored in Heap
    email: String, // since this is String, value is stored in Heap
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
	// if mut is added with user1 then the below updation will work
    let user1 = User {
	    // order of key-values doesnt matter
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
	// update value of email, only if variable is mutable.
	user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");

```
- If the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in a function, we can use the _field init shorthand_ syntax
```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    // return struct with values
    User { 
        email, // this is email: email,
        username, // this also similar
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```
- Struct-Update-Syntax: can create another instance using first struct values.
	- Creating a new struct from already defined struct, the pointer will point to same data in HEAP for the same values, like in this case `username`, (Only for String, Static datatypes will be saved in new Stack of `user2` only)
```rust
	 let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
    
    // better way
	let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1 // get other details, always written in last.
    };
}
```
