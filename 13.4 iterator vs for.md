We ran a benchmark by loading the entire contents of _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a `String` and looking for the word _the_ in the contents. Here are the results of the benchmark on the version of `search` using the `for` loop and the version using iterators:

```text
test bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)
test bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)
```

The iterator version was slightly faster! We wonâ€™t explain the benchmark code here, because the point is not to prove that the two versions are equivalent but to get a general sense of how these two implementations compare performance-wise.
