_Refactoring to improve Modularity and Error Handling_

##### 1. Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects
_As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for one task._

Rust community has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a binary program when `main` starts getting large. This process has the following steps:

-   Split your program into a _main.rs_ and a _lib.rs_ and move your program’s logic to _lib.rs_.

The responsibilities that remain in the `main` function after this process should be limited to the following:

-   Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
-   Setting up any other configuration
-   Calling a `run` function in _lib.rs_
-   Handling the error if `run` returns an error

_Because you can’t test the `main` function directly, this structure lets you test all of your program’s logic by moving it into functions in `lib.rs`. The code that remains in `main.rs` will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading it._

##### 2. Extracting the Argument Parser
_The longer `main` becomes, the more variables we’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group the configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear._

##### 3. Grouping Configuration Values


- We are using `struct` for 2 arguments.
- Doing so will make it easier for future maintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and what their purpose is.
###### The Trade-Offs of Using `clone`

There’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using `clone` to fix ownership problems because of its runtime cost. In [Chapter 13](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch13-00-functional-features.html), you’ll learn how to use more efficient methods in this type of situation.

##### 4. Fixing the Error Handling

_We’ve used `expect` to print an error message when reading the file fails, but the error message just prints `Error reading the file`. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for example, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it. Right now, regardless of the situation, we’d print the same error message for everything, which wouldn’t give the user any information!_

- Return a `Result<T, E>` instead of `panic!` to gracefully tell the user for errors.

We’re also going to change the function name from `new` to `build` because many programmers expect `new` functions to never fail.
- error values will always be string literals that have the `'static` lifetime.
- `unwrap_or_else` is used on `Option` type values for non-`panic!` error handling. **Detailed definition in [[13.1 closures]]**
	- If `Option` returns `Some` then the value is saved to the variable which called this.
		- `unwrap` too has the same functionality.
	- Else for `None` we can define the behaviour in `closure` aka Anonymous Function aka `unwrap_or_else(|error|{})`  
		- [ Chapter 13 ]
```rust
// are both the same?

// some_value holds Option<T> type data

let x = match some_value {
	Some(value) => value,
	None => panic!("Failed")
};

let x = some_value.unwrap().expect("Failed");
```
- We use `if let` where we want to handle only `Err` and not `Ok` (Ok case could return void value like so: `Ok(())` ) rather than using `unwrap_or_else`.
- The `run` function doesn’t return a value that we want to `unwrap` in the same way that `Config::build` returns the `Config` instance. Because `run` returns `()` in the success case, we only care about detecting an error, so we don’t need `unwrap_or_else` to return the unwrapped value, which would only be `()`.
