_Command line programs are expected to send error messages to the standard error stream `stderr` so we can still see error messages on the screen even if we redirect the standard output stream to a file._

- If program is success:
	- `stdout`
	- save in file
- If program fails
	- `stderr`
	- show in terminal and dont save
```bash
# store stdout in output.txt file
cargo run > output.txt
```
- Currently the error msgs are also sent to `stdout`
- we need to fix this

Printing Errors to Standard Error
---
- use `eprintln` macro to print error in `stderr`

Summary of chapter 12
---
This chapter recapped some of the major concepts you’ve learned so far and covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust. By using command line arguments, files, environment variables, and the `eprintln!` macro for printing errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. Combined with the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well organized, store data effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors nicely, and be well tested.
