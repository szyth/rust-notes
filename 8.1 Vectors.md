- `Vec<T>`, where T is type
	- `push(), pop(), len()`, etc
- can only store values of the same type.
- useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file, etc
```rust
// type annotation since we didnt initialize value to it
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); 
```
- More often, you’ll create a `Vec<T>` with initial values and Rust will infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type annotation.
- Vectors are implemented using generics [ Chapter 10 ]

---
- Rust conveniently provides the `vec!` macro
```rust
// type annotation not needed since we provided values.
// infered type is i32, ie default Int type
// Vec<i32>
let v = vec![1,2,3];
```

---
Updating Vector
---
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new()
v.push(1); // type infered as i32
v.push(2);
v.push(3);
```
- we can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same scope. [chapter 4]
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0]; // Compile Error, 'first' is immutable, cant hold mutable reference.

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {}", first); // immutable borrow later used here
```
---
Reading Vector
---
- `get()` 
	- Preferred, since handles data gracefully using `Option<T>`, even for invalid inputs
- `[]`
	- Code panics and exits for Invalid Inputs.
```rust
let v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];

// []
let third: &i32 = &v[2]; // third = 3

// get()
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
	Some(num) => num, // return value if valid
	None => print!("There is no third element.")
}
```
---
Iteration
---
- `for` loop over immutable references to each element in a `vector<i32>` :
	-  use `*` dereference operator to get reference value.
```rust
let v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
for ref in &v { // ref has type &i32, needed i32 so used *
	let sum = *ref + 1; 
	print!("{}", sum);
}
```
- `for` loop over mutable references to each element in a mut `vector<i32>` :
```rust
let mut v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
for ref in &mut v {
	// ref has type &mut i32
	*ref += 50;
}
```
- One way to iterate over a vector without using a pointer is with a range
	- `0 .. v.len()`
---
Using Enums to store Multiple Types
---
```rust
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
    ];

```
- Using an enum plus a `match` expression means that Rust will ensure at compile time that every possible case is handled. [ Chapter 6.]
---
Dropping a vector drops its elements
---
- Like any other `struct`, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope
- When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is valid.
```rust
 {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

        // do stuff with v
    } // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```
