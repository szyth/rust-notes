_Unrecoverable Error_
- To cause a panic, we can:
	- explicitly call `panic!` macro.
		- `panic!("crash and burn");`
	- or some bug in program which causes progam to panic.
- When a code panics, rust performs the following:
	- failure message
	- unwind
		- means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it encounters.
		- Its a memory intensive task, so we can choose _abort_ in which clean up isnt done, and the OS does the cleanup.
		- choosing `aborting` over `unwinding` results in a smaller binary
		- add following in `cargo.toml` to do aborting:
			- `[profile.release]  panic = 'abort'`
	- clean up the stack
	- quit.

Rust against _buffer overread_:
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v[99]; // could access memory beyond the vector, but cant.
}
```
- Program will panic, and protect from buffer overread unlike in `C Lang`

#### Backtrace
_Via an environment variable, Rust can display the call stack when a panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic._

- we can set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error.
- A _backtrace_ is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this point. ( Similar to Stack Trace in Firefox Devtools )
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run`
- backtrace works only when `--release` is not provided, ie, the program is run in debug mode ( which is a default behaviour ).
