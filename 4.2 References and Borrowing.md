from other book:
- References
	- some_function(&str)
	- when a some_function(str: String) is called, str dies in that scope (due to some_function taking ownership of str).
	- to keep the str alive, use references, some_function(&str)
	- Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. Weâ€™re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.
- A **reference** is a kind of pointer
```rust
fn main() {
    let m1 = String::from("Hello");
    let m2 = String::from("world");
    greet(&m1, &m2); // note the ampersands, else next line will fail due to ownership and borrowing of variables by greet()
    let s = format!("{} {}", m1, m2);
}

fn greet(g1: &String, g2: &String) { // note the ampersands
    println!("{} {}!", g1, g2);
}
```

from other book:
- Mutable References
	- some_function(&mut str)
	- this way the referenced variable can be modified inside some_function(some_string: &mut String){}
