- Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called _collections_.
- unlike array or tuples, the data these collections point to is stored on the HEAP, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.
	-   A _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
	-   A _string_ is a collection of characters/bytes.
	-   A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.
