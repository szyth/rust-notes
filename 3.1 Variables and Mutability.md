- By default variables are immutable. 
- Make them mutable by adding `mut`
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6; // Compile Error, since x is immutable
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

>`const` can be used in the global scope, and `let` can only be used in a function

#### Constants
- Immutable by default, can never be changed.
- Naming convention: ALL Uppercase with underscore.
```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

---
#### Shadowing
- we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
- use `let` again to reinitialize else youll get mutability error.
- cant use `mut` in first initialize.
```rust
	// SHADOWING, compiles fine
    let spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len(); // this will fail, missing let.
    let spaces = spaces.len(); // mandatory let keyword for shadowing

	// MUTABILITY, Compile Error, different types String and Int.
	let mut spaces = "   ";
	spaces = spaces.len();
```
