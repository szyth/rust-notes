_Generic Data types creates definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types._

___
i) In Function Definitions
---
- Below is a program to find Largest of `int` and `char` in separate functions.
- Code duplication can be seen (Monomorphized code, refer end of doc):
```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[&i32]) -> &i32 {
	let mut largest = &list[0];
	
	for item in list{
		if item > largest {
			largest = item;
		}	
	}
	largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
- You can use any identifier as a type parameter name but `T` is the default choice of most Rust programmers.
- `fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {}`
	- Read this definition as: _the function `largest` is generic over some type `T`_
- Removing code duplication with Generic Types `T` (code duplication is fixed but one compile error is still there, will fix in 10.2): 
```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
    // compile error, > operator cant work with T as T could also be a File which is not comparable.
        if item > largest { 
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
- Unlike languages like Java where all objects have a set of core methods like [`Object.toString()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString()), there are no core methods in Rust. **Without restrictions, a generic type `T` has no capabilities: it cannot be printed, cloned, or mutated (although it can be dropped).**
	- Refer [[10.2 Traits]]
---
ii) in Struct definitions
---
- The syntax for using generics in struct definitions is similar to that used in function definitions.
```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };

	// compile error, different types of x, y aka int and float
	let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```
- _the `Point<T>` struct is generic over some type `T`, and the fields `x` and `y` are **both that same type**_
	- Which means that x and y has to be of a same type.
- To have _Generics of Different Types_, do the following:
```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```
>_Note: using more generic types than a few makes your code hard to read. If you're finding you need lots of generic types in your code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller pieces._

---
iii) In Enum definitions 
---
- Generic of 1 Type:
```rust
// Standard library definition
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```
- Generic of 2 types:
```rust
// Standard library definition
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```
> _When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can avoid duplication by using generic types instead._

---
iv) in Method Definitions 
---
```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn get_x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.get_x());
}
```
---
Performance of Code using _Generics_
---
Using generic types won't make our program run any slower than it would with concrete types.
- Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time. 
- _Monomorphization_ is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled. 
- In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used to create the generic function of above `Option<T>` program; the compiler looks at all the places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types the generic code is called with.
- The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following:
```rust
enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
```
- we pay no runtime cost for using generics. 
- When the code runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by hand. 
- The process of monomorphization makes Rustâ€™s generics extremely efficient at runtime.
