- Returning `Result` is a good default choice when you’re defining a function that might fail.
- In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it’s more appropriate to write code that `panics` instead of returning a `Result`
- If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you’ll never have an `Err` variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call `unwrap`, and even better to document the reason you think you’ll never have an `Err` variant in the `expect` text:
```rust
    use std::net::IpAddr;

    let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
        .parse()
        .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");
```
- here `parse` returns `Result<T,E>`. Since the hardcoded `IpAddr` string is a valid IP, it wont have the `Err` variant but the compiler isnt smart enough to know about it , only the humans know that the hardcoded IP value is correct, so we used `expect`.
- On cases where user enters the IP, the `Err` case will be Valid.
---
- If a user enters values that don’t make sense, it’s best to return an error if you can so the user can decide what they want to do in that case. 
- However, in cases where continuing could be insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call `panic!` and alert the person.
- However, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a `Result` than to make a `panic!` call.
	- Examples include a parser being given malformed data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate limit.
- _Buffer overread_ always results in `Panic!` because the _function contract_ is violated
---
- Having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system.
- If your function has a particular type as a parameter:
	- rather than an `Option`, your program expects to have _something_ rather than _nothing_. Your code then doesn’t have to handle two cases for the `Some` and `None` variants: it will only have one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime.
	- using an unsigned integer type such as `u32`, which ensures the parameter is never negative.
---
#### Guessing Game error handling:
_use struct with i32 so that only numbers are accepted._
```rust
pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.", value);
        }

        Guess { value }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}
```
- A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a `Guess` rather than an `i32` and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.
