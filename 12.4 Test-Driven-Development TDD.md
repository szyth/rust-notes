the test-driven development (TDD) process uses the following steps:

1.  Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect.
2.  Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
3.  Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass.
4.  Repeat from step 1!

_Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process._
