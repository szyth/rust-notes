- known as `destructor` in general programming term. 
	- `destructor` is analogous to a `constructor` which creates an Instance.
- by `impl` drop trait, we can customize and specify a code to run when a value is about to go out of scope.
- to `impl` drop, we define a method `drop()` which takes *mutable reference to self*.
	- `fn drop(&mut self)`
- more like `ngOnDestroy()` lifecycle hook in Angular, all the code inside this Hook is executed before the Component is Destroyed.
```rust
struct CustomPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("print before {} goes out of scope", self.data)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let y = CustomPointer {
        data: String::from("First Pointer"),
    };
	let z = CustomPointer {
        data: String::from("Second Pointer"),
    };

    println!("Closing main")
}
/////////////////////////// OUTPUT ////////////////
Closing main
print before Second Pointer goes out of scope
print before First Pointer goes out of scope
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
```
- note that Out-of-Scoping is done in REVERSE, as it printed `Second Pointer` then `First Pointer`.
- Meaning variables are dropped in the reverse order of their creation.

### Cleanup and dropping value at choice
#### `std::mem::drop`

- `Drop` trait is run automatically to cleanup and drop data at End of Variable scope.
	- Meaning we can't manually call `drop(&mut self)` for cleanup.
	- if we DO run `y.drop()` , we get `double free error`, as once we manually called it, then Rust too again calls it when going out of scope, hence the Error.
```rust
fn main() {
    let y = CustomPointer {
        data: String::from("First Pointer"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    y.drop(); // ERROR: double free error, cant call MANUALLY
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```
- However there might be need to FORCE drop a value BEFORE the variable goes out of scope.
	- One example is when using smart pointers that manage locks: you might want to force the `drop` method that releases the lock so that other code in the same scope can acquire the lock.
- use `drop(y)` from `std::mem::drop` and NOT `y.drop()`
```rust
fn main() {
    let y = CustomPointer {
        data: String::from("First Pointer"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    drop(y); // WORKS, std::mem::drop
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```
