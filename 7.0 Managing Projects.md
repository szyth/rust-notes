- As a project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules and then multiple files.
- A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external dependencies.
- For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated packages that evolve together, Cargo provides _workspaces_. Chapter 14
- You can create scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two items with the same name in the same scope

 To manage our code’s organization we have _module system_ which includes:
-   **Packages:** A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
-   **Crates:** A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
-   **Modules** and **use:** Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
-   **Paths:** A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module
