Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`

Our `grep` project will combine a number of concepts youâ€™ve learned so far:
-   Organizing code (using what you learned about modules in [Chapter 7](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html))
-   Using vectors and strings (collections, [Chapter 8](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch08-00-common-collections.html))
-   Handling errors ([Chapter 9](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch09-00-error-handling.html))
-   Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate ([Chapter 10](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch10-00-generics.html))
-   Writing tests ([Chapter 11](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch11-00-testing.html))
